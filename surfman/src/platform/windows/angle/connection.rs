//! A connection to the window server.
//! 
//! It might seem like this should wrap an `EGLDisplay`, but it doesn't. Unfortunately, in the
//! ANGLE implementation `EGLDisplay` is not thread-safe, while `surfman` connections must be
//! thread-safe. So we need to use the DXGI/Direct3D concept of a connection instead. These are
//! implicit in the Win32 API, and as such this type is a no-op.
